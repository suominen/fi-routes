# Routes and networks

This repo has some recipes for collecting route data from RIPEstat and
published network block data from Google Cloud.

## Finnish routes

An example on how one could collect specific routes, such as major
Finnish ISPs, from RIPEstat.

According to RIPEstat there are 366 ASNs in Finland.  Only a handful of
them are collected by this setup.

## Google networks

An example on how one could collect the network blocks for specific
regions of the Google Cloud Platform.
